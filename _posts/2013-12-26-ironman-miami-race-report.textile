I am already planning to participate in this race in 2014. I loved every aspect of it, and can't really miss such a quality event so close to home. My 2014 plan is to train more frequently, and stay healthy all year, being injured and/or sick on and off really hurt my performance, and I wasn't able to be at my best. I feel I could have gone at least 20 minutes faster just had I not been sick before the race. For 2014, I'm setting two goals, goal #1 is to go faster than this year, which should not be too hard, unless something goes really wrong suring the year. Goal #2 is to go under 6 hours - 5:59:59 would do it, I will need to be over 48 minutes faster to reach that goal, which is a lot, but I don't think it's over what I can do, I get motivated by goals that feel a bit out of reach; so, be it.
