h2. Swim

I was very anxious before the swim, I had never swam the distance in training, and hadn't had a swim in open water in months. I was in one of the late waves, and had to wait for around 90 minutes after the pro start to get on the water, I spent most of that time trying to stretch and relax. It was a non-wetsuit swim, which I was hoping for because I hadn't used my wetsuit in months, and didn't want to risk using one with no practice. I started at the back of my wave, and managed to find a good rythm after the first 5 agitated minutes. I really liked my swim, I was able to keep an easy constant pace all the time, and even had time to enjoy the view; so, I'll take that as a first 1.2 miles swim experience.

Time: 51:15

h2. Bike

I started what would be my first 56-miles bike ride feeling great, but spent the first two miles fighting with my Garmin watch, trying to start it, and learnt that it doesn't respond well to touch when wet, which was a pain most of the race. I was planning to ride and run based on my heart rate data; so, it was important to get the watch working. The only event worth noting on the first half of the course was that I lost my only hydration bottle when riding over some train tracks around mile 5, I initially freaked out, but ended up doing well with the hydration provided on the course. The last half of the ride was a bit painful, I couldn't find strength in my legs to push the pace even with my heart rate being below my race goal, that's when I started feeling the lack of proper preparation. We got a headwind in the last 30 minutes, which brought my speed further down, and increased the pain level a notch. I was very glad to reach the finish line with a somehow disappointing time to over 3 hours and 20 minutes, I was hoping to get really close to the 3 hours mark.

Time: 3:21:34

h2. Run

The run was very positive, I managed to keep my heart rate around my planned goal, and had a decent run for the conditions. This course has two challenges, the first one is the long tall bridge, which we had to climb 4 times, it turned out to be harder than anticipated as I don't have a single hill to train on. The second and toughest challenge was starting the run around 1PM, there was no cloud cover for the whole run, it was hot even for someone who trains in those conditions. I'm so glad there were water stops every mile, it helped me keep hydrated and cool. I was able to finish the race in a decent pace, and really enjoyed the experience.

Time: 2:24:41

h2. Overall

I am already planning to participate in this race in 2014. I loved every aspect of it, and can't really miss such a quality event so close to home. My 2014 plan is to train more frequently, and stay healthy all year, being injured and/or sick on and off really hurt my performance, I wasn't able to be at my best. I feel I could have gone at least 20 minutes faster just had I not been sick before the race. For 2014, I'm setting two goals, goal #1 is to go faster than this year, which should not be too hard, unless something goes really wrong during the year. Goal #2 is to go under 6 hours - 5:59:59 would do it, I have to be 48 minutes faster to reach that goal, which is a lot, but I don't think it's over what I can do, I have A LOT of room for improvement in all 3 sports, and get motivated by goals that feel a bit out of reach; so, be it.
