h1. 2014 2575 Las Olas Triathlon race report

On Mar 17th 2014, I ran the "2575 Las Olas Triathlon":http://2575lasolas.com/. The highlight of this race is the course, racing right by the beach in a gorgeous part of the South Florida was a lot of fun, and I think I'll be coming back to this race again. I was shooting for a 1:20 finish, but came short by 4 minutes, which is not all bad considering the race conditions - detailed result is "here":http://accuchip.racetecresults.com/MyResults.aspx?CId=16337&RId=2111&EId=7&AId=64161.

h3. Swim

I have been going to Master swimming classes for a couple of months now, and have improved my technique a lot, started to swim a lot more, and am feeling much more comfortable in the water in general. My goal was to really benefit from my new swim skills; however, the swim was a bit of a disaster, it was very windy and the sea was really agitated, with constant waves of various heights. The water was so rough that the swim distance was reduced from 750m to 600m, which is not a lot, but did help. It was really the type of sea that no sane person would try to swim in if it wasn't for the race. I came out of the water in 13:30, was feeling dizzy, with a very high heart rate. I walked part of the way to transition to calm down, I easily lost one minute just in transition.

h3. Bike

I started the bike with a high heart rate from the swim effort, and decided to take it easy the first two miles, which turned out to be a mistake, there was a good tailwind that I didn't really use to my advantage. After the 2 miles mark, I got into a great groove and was actually happy with my bike effort. I did slow down a lot for the 2 miles of headwind going South, and in some portions of the bike course that had a lot of traffic; but, did actually race hard in some portions of the course.

h3. Run

The run was a very pleasant surprise :). I had a single brick workout this year, I had done 1 hour on the bike followed by a 50 minutes run, and had felt extremely well. I'm really glad this translated into my race day performance. I also started feeling an old ankle injury a couple of weeks before the race, and assumed that it could affect my race, but it didn't. I ran 5km in 25:04, which is a 5K PR by 10 seconds for me. I held a very constant pace, and pushed through the last mile for a great finish.

h3. Overall

Despite the fact that I was 4 minutes shy of the 1:20 finish goal, I had a fun race, and know that I can do much better in calmer conditions. I don't have the rest of my triathlon season planned out yet, just know that I will be doing 70.3 Miami again this year. For now, I will keep my swim focus in the next few weeks, which will hopefully help heal my ankle for good - it started to hurt the after the race. I will very likely do another sprint triathlon soon for the fun of racing hard.
