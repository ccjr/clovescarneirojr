h1. 2014 Miami Marathon race report

On Feb 2nd 2014, I ran the half at the 2014 Miami Marathon. I really liked the race organization, course and overall atmosphere at this event, and will be coming back as long as I live in the area, definitely worth the effort. 

My overall training mileage and run mileage have been really low the last 3 months. I took a break from training the last 3 months, and only ran a total of 80 miles, which is really low for proper half-marathon preparation. Regardless of my lack of training, I set my goal to hit the race under 2 hours, which would be a 5 minutes PR for me. For the first time, I ran a race with a friend, he was planning to complete the full marathon under the 4 hours mark; so, it made sense to run together. The first few miles went really well, we kept a pace close to 9:00/mile; however, I started feeling the effort around mile 7 and my legs completely gave up at the 9 mile mark, and I had to run the last 3 miles at a 11:00/mile pace. I reached the finish line in 2:10, which was a bit disappointing, but still enjoyed the experience, I've learnt to appreciate being able to exercise and be active depiste race results.

h2. Lessons and next steps

The first lesson is to approach races with a realistic goal. I am sure I could have finished 5 minutes faster had I ran with a 2:05 finish in mind. Pacing is the key for good finish times in running, there's no way around that, a pace that is too fast will slow down any runner way more than expected. The funny thing is that I already knew that, just didn't apply it to this race.

I'm focusing training for triathlons; so, it's hard to beat my previous PR when all I did was running. Before I try to beat my HM PR, I will try to match it again. If I can manage to run another half marathon with a finish time around 2:04, then I'll start to think about breaking the 2:00 mark again. I think that taking smaller steps will be the key to improvement for me. I should be very happy to match my PR with only 2 or 3 runs per week. The main lesson is "know your limitations". I don't have another half marathon planned for this year yet, but will very likely try to find another one soon.
