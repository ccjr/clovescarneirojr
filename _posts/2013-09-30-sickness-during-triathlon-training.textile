h1. Sickness during triathlon training

I had an amazing month of training in August, and had high expectations for September; however, training came to a complete halt for almost the whole month due to illness. Around Sep 1st, my daugther got sick with flu-like symptons, then passed it to my son and to myself, the following days were a sickness-fest, and I ended up being hit with a virus and pinkeye. I was coughing a lot, and ended up having to visit a ER after both kids were feeling better, and was diagnosed with bronchitis, which can take up to 4 weeks to clear up.
I did not train at all until Sep 20th, when I went out for a short bike ride. I noticed a shortness of breath almost instantly, and saw my heart rate spike to above 175 BPM, which never happens when I'm biking; so, I did cut the workout short, and have since tried to swim and run only to be hit with the same issues. I completely wrote off the full month, and will try to rest more, despite the itch I'm feeling to go train more.

h2. Half Ironman Implications

In my training plan, September was the month of long rides and long runs, I wanted to ride the race distance a couple of times, and get a few 10 miles runs under my belt. Those distances wouldn't have been very challenging at my pre-sickness fitness level; but, I don't think that I'll be able to get those miles before race day, just because of the recovery time, and being now just 30 days away from the race.

My current goal is to train as much as possible without pushing too hard, and make sure I don't get sick again before the race. I still don't know how much fitness I lost, but I lost a lot of confidence, which is as essential to a decent performance. I really wanted to chase a specific finish time for Ironman 70.3 Miami 2013, but I will have to just enjoy the experience, and finish happy, that would be awesome after this month's events.
