    I co-authored <a href="http://amzn.com/1590596862">Beginning Rails</a>, published in 2007, and <a href="http://amzn.com/1430224339">Beginning Rails 3</a>, published in August 2010 by Apress. "Beginning Rails 3" is the practical starting point for anyone wanting to learn how to build dynamic web applications using the latest release of the Ruby on Rails framework. You'll learn how all of the components of Rails fit together and how you can leverage them to create sophisticated web applications with less code and more joy.
