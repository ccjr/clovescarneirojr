  <h1>Still building software</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a software engineer, who's been working with building software since 1997, specially web-based applications. 
    In terms of technology, my career is pretty much separated into two parts: Java and Ruby. 
    I've built web applications for large telecommunication companies, such as Manitoba Telecommunications(MTS), AMCTV, We.tv, News12, and SportSkool using Java frameworks, including Struts, Webwork and Spring. 
    Since 2006, I've moved to the Ruby camp, and have really enjoyed working full-time with Ruby and Rails; dynamic and easily-testable languages as the way to go. 
    I wrote a couple of <a href="/book.html">Ruby on Rails books</a>, "Beginning Rails" and "Beginning Rails 3" for Apress.
    I am currently working for <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> in Seattle, Washington.
